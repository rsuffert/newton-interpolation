## Scope
Program that performs interpolation through the Newton's polynomial. This has been developed as the third and last assignment for the Numeric Methods class.

## Folder structure
- `bin`: where the compiled `.class` Java files are stored.
- `docs`: where the directions of the assignment and the final PDF report are stored.
- `src`: where the Java source-code is stored.

## Using the program
The main class is the `NewtonPolynomial` class. It contains some utility methods for performing interpolation using Newton's polynomial, and those methods are documented through Javadoc, so your IDE should probably have built-in IntelliSense support for helping you with using and reading the documentation of the methods of the class. If not, you may manually generate the Java API-style documentation through Javadoc or install an extension to your IDE. The `Test` class also provides a sample usage of the `NewtonPolynomial` utility class.
